# RandonPythonProjects
Just Some Random Python Projects I Do When I'm bored. Take the code if you want bad code.
If the code is cringe, I'm sorry. I'm basically just free balling my way into python with prior experience in lua. So basically I am learning all the different syntax and api by googling things that I would use in LUA.


Sorry for the eye cancer.
